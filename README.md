What is a branch?
When developing software, developers often collaborate on tasks such as new development and bug fixing on the same source code. In this case, "Branch" is a function that allows multiple developers to do various tasks at the same time.
In other words, a project can be divided into several branches and managed through a branch. Each independent branch can work by changing the source code at will, and then create another new version compared to the original version.
